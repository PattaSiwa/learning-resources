# Learning Resources

### About this project

    This is a full-stack web application that compiled free online learning resources. I have been working as a Youth Support Specialist and one of the biggest challenges we had during the Covid-19 Pandemic was finding appropriate resources to support our students. Most of the resources we had were links and e-mails of links my colleagues and I have sent to each other. I thought it was about time that these resources get centralized. My hope for this project is to help educators and parents by providing a space they could come to find and share learning resources.
